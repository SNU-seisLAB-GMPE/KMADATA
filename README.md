# KMADATA
Ground-Motion database based on the Korean National Seismic Network administered by Korean Meteorological Administration.
- data description : The database was constructed in the form of a flatfile with RotD50 peak ground acceleration, 5% damped pseudo-spectral acceleration, and meta information such as hypocenter, path, site, and data processing. The seismic data are the velocity and accelerogram data for events over ML 3.0 observed by the Korean National Seismic Network administered by Korea Meteorological Administration between 2003 and 2019.
